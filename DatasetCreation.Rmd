# Introduction

This is a living document that will contain code and documentation for creation of a dataset of social determinants for a project on stimulant overdoses. Changes to this document will be recorded in commits to GitHub.

# Census API Data

Much of the social determinants of health data can be gathered from the 1-Year estimates of the American Community Survey. This data can be accessed directly through the US Census API.
